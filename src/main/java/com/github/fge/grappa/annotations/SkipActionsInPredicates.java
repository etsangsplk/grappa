/**
 * Do not run actions in "predicate" rules ({@code test} and {@code testNot})
 *
 * <p>{@link Action}s can be used to perform user defined operations, which can
 * include, for instance, setting values into beans etc. For instance:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     Rule myRule()
 *     {
 *         return sequence(someRule(), storeSomeValue());
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The problem is that you may also use such rules in a {@code test} or
 * {@code testNot} rule such as in:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     Rule otherRule()
 *     {
 *         return sequence(testNot(myRule()), someOtherRule());
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>In this case, you may not want {@code storeSomeValue()} to be executed in
 * that particular context. This annotation helps with that.</p>
 *
 * <p>You can either use it at the rule level or at the class level. If at the
 * class level, it will affect all rules with defined actions.</p>
 *
 * <p>If at the class level, you can also use the {@link
 * DontSkipActionsInPredicates} annotation on a rule to override this
 * annotation.</p>
