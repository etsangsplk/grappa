/**
 * Main interface to run parser instances against a character input
 */
/*
 * TODO: separation of concerns
 *
 * The problem here is that a MatcherContext, as currently defined, mixes
 * pure parsing data (input buffer, getting data from it etc) and semantics
 * (the value stack, for instance).
 *
 * And to make matters worse, a MatcherContext is the argument of a Matcher's
 * .match() method :/ See also Matcher's .getSubcontext(), which is an eyesore.
 * Its result is only ever different for an ActionMatcher!!
 *
 * The matching process (probably the "controller" as defined by the book)
 * should probably be the one here to distinguish between the different "rule
 * types" that we have; for instance, the fact that a Rule is in fact an Action,
 * and that when in a Sequence, the first rule, if an Action, may not call
 * certain methods.
 *
 * Of course, there remains a more fundamental problem, in that at this moment
 * what is considered to be the "semantic output" of a parsing run is the top
 * value of a parser's ValueStack; this, in itself, is a mistake. If that is to
 * change, a lot of bytecode generation routines will have to change as well.
 * Great.
