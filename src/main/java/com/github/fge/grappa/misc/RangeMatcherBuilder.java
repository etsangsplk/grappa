     * <p>The simplifications are as follows:</p>

     *     <li>[1..1]: returns the rule itself.</li>

     * <p>If none of these apply, this method delegates as follows:</p>
     *
     * <ul>
     *     <li>[n..+âˆž) for whatever n: delegates to {@link #boundedDown(int)};
     *     </li>
     *     <li>[0..n] for n &gt;= 2: delegates to {@link #boundedUp(int)};</li>
     *     <li>[n..n] for n &gt;= 2: delegates to {@link #exactly(int)};</li>
     *     <li>[n..m] with 0 &lt; n &lt; m: delegates to {@link
